# Feature definition

The following table presents the definition of all the stock features provided with `musif`.

The first column are Python Regular Expressions that match the relevant columns of the
final DataFrame.

Finally, the _Stock module_ column lists the module distributed in `musif` and that generates each feature.

Note that none of these features works on percussion instruments.

In addition to the features in the present page, the feature in the `'music21'` stock
module provides all the features from `music21`, while those in the
`'jsymbolic` module provide the features extracted using `jSymbolic`. For this, you
jSymbolic will be downloaded at the first run ad you will eed Java installed
in your OS. You can force the download od jSymbolic and the check of Java
installatio by running `python -m musif.extract.features.jsymbolic`
